        <h3>What do you eat in a Mediterranean diet?</h3>
        <p>The Mediterranean diet consists of many foods found in regions that border the Mediterranean Sea. These types of foods provide a variety of vitamins and nutrients that nourish our body. Food groups that are part of the Mediterranean diet include:

     <h3>Fruits and vegetables</h3>
     <p>Nuts and seeds, including almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds
     <p>Beans and legumes, such as lentils, chickpeas, black beans, and kidney beans
        <p>Whole grains like whole wheat bread, quinoa, brown rice, and whole wheat pasta
            <p>Fish and seafood
                <p>Healthy fats and oils, including extra virgin olive oil and avocado and nut oils


     <h3>What foods are not part of the Mediterranean diet?</h3>
     <p>If you're trying to follow the Mediterranean diet, eat these items less often or in small amounts:

     <p>Highly processed foods (such as sodas, sugary fruit juices and chips)

     <p>Fatty or processed meats (such as bacon, sausages, hot dogs and deli meats)
     <p>High sodium foods (such as salted nuts, instant soups and canned products)
     <p>Foods high in saturated fats (such as beef, coconut oil, butter and processed cheese)
     <p>These types of foods are often linked to various health issues like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. They tend to be high in unhealthy fats, sugars and sodium, which contributes to poor health.


     <h3>What are the benefits of a Mediterranean diet?</h3>

     <p>Sleep quality: Researchers found that the Mediterranean diet is linked to better sleep quality, improves sleep efficiency and reduces the time it takes to fall asleep.
     <p>Cancer risk: The Mediterranean diet is rich in fiber, healthy fats and anti-inflammatory foods. These can lower the risk of certain cancers.
     <p>Mental health: The Mediterranean diet is shown to improve mental health and quality of life. It can also reduce depression and cognitive decline.

     <p>Add more fruits and vegetables: Start small. Add a little bit of fruit or a few vegetables into your eating routine.

Be creative. Find something that works for your eating routine.
     <p>Incorporate whole grains: Slowly replace refined grains with whole grain alternatives. For example, if you like white rice, consider gradually switching to brown rice.
